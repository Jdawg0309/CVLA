PATCH ID: 1
TITLE: Wire tool palette input behavior
FILES TOUCHED:
- docs/patchfile_2026-01-17_051402.md (created)
- app/app.py (modified)
- app/app_handlers.py (modified)
- ui/panels/tool_palette/tool_palette.py (modified)

SUMMARY:
- Enabled tool-driven mouse behavior for select/move/rotate/add actions.
- Restored full tool palette list to expose available tools.
- Why it was changed: Implements the Tool Palette wiring gap in docs/AUDIT_REPORT.md.

INVARIANTS CHECK:
- State ownership preserved? Yes; input handlers dispatch actions or update camera only.
- No new features added? Yes.
- No UI behavior change? Yes; existing tools now drive their intended interactions.
- CLI not introduced yet? Yes.

DIFF / ACTIONS:
- Added panning flag to app input state and used active_tool to branch mouse input.
- Add vector/matrix tools dispatch existing actions; move/rotate map to pan/orbit.
- Restored tool list entries in the tool palette.
- Sanity checks: `python3 -m compileall .`, `python3 main.py --help`.

STATUS:
- Patch complete
- Waiting for next instruction
