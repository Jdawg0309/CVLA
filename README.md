# CVLA - Complete Visual Linear Algebra

A comprehensive 3D linear algebra visualization tool with an intuitive interface for exploring vectors, matrices, and linear transformations.

## Features

### Core Visualization
- **3D Vector Visualization**: Visualize vectors in 3D space with customizable colors and labels
- **Interactive Camera**: Orbit, pan, and zoom with intuitive mouse controls
- **Multiple View Modes**: 2D/3D toggle, orthographic/perspective projections
- **Grid Systems**: Customizable grid on XY, XZ, YZ planes or full 3D cube

### Linear Algebra Operations
- **Vector Operations**: Addition, subtraction, dot product, cross product, normalization
- **Matrix Operations**: Create and apply transformation matrices
- **Linear Systems**: Solve systems of equations with Gaussian elimination
- **Projections**: Visualize vector projections onto axes and planes

### Enhanced UI
- **Modern Interface**: Clean, dark-themed UI with intuitive controls
- **Real-time Inspector**: Detailed property inspection for selected objects
- **Contextual Toolbar**: Quick access to common operations
- **Tabbed Interface**: Organized workspace with vector, matrix, and system tabs

### Advanced Features
- **Gaussian Elimination**: Step-by-step visualization of solving linear systems
- **Null Space/Column Space**: Compute and visualize fundamental subspaces
- **Transformation History**: Track and revert vector transformations
- **Export Capabilities**: Export vectors to JSON, CSV, or Python code
