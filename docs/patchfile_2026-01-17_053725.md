SUMMARY:
- Added SetSelectedPixel action and reducer handling to update selected_pixel in state.
- Wired Image tool clicks to select pixels on the image plane and display values in the Images tab.
- Why it was changed: Implements selected_pixel behavior per docs/AUDIT_REPORT.md.

INVARIANTS CHECK:
- State ownership preserved? Yes; selection updates go through actions/reducer.
- No new features added? Yes; wires existing selected_pixel state.
- No UI behavior change? Yes; existing Image tool now reports pixel selection.
- CLI not introduced yet? Yes.

DIFF / ACTIONS:
- Added SetSelectedPixel action and excluded it from history.
- Image tool click maps screen ray to image plane pixel coordinates.
- Images tab displays selected pixel and value (raw or processed).
- Sanity checks: `python3 -m compileall .`, `python3 main.py --help`.

STATUS:
- Patch complete
- Waiting for next instruction
